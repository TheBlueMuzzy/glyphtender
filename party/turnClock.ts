// THE TURN CLOCK — after every change: whose turn is it, and does the server have to play it?
//   · a bot has the seat (the player left, idled, or stayed away past botTakesOverAfterMs) → the server
//     plays the turn after botTurnDelayMs, so the others can watch it happen
//   · the host turned the timer on → the turn (incl. its refresh) must be played in time; if not, the server
//     plays a legal turn for them and the rooms module counts a missed turn (2 in a row → a bot takes the seat)
// Turns the server plays: the greedy bot (src/engine/bot.ts — a real move + cast, never a pass), deciding from that
// seat's VIEW only, never the whole game (F36), and "keep all" on a refresh. Beta swaps in a real AI personality
// there (design/online.md §6).
