// THE ONLINE SERVER — party/worker.ts hands every room to this class (Cloudflare, via PartyServer). One room code = one copy of it.
// The rooms module (src/rooms/server/) runs the room: seats, host, join, rejoin, idle players, bots.
// Glyphtender's rules are in ./glyphtenderRules.ts; what each player may see is in ./views.ts.
// Room knobs (seats, timings, turn timers) are in content/rooms.json.
//   Local:  npm run party:dev   (port 1997)   ·   Live: npm run party:deploy (see worker.ts)
// Server code only: no React, no Dev Kit, nothing that needs a browser.
