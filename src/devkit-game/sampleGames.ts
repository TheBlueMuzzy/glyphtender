// SAMPLE GAMES FOR THE DEV KIT'S SCREEN PREVIEWS (previews.tsx) — real games, played by the engine's own sim
// players from a fixed seed, so every preview shows the same believable numbers each time (and keeps working
// when the rules change — nothing here is hand-written game state).
//   finishedGame: played to the end (greedy players: they make words, so the end table has something to show)
//   tiedGame:     the first seed whose 2-player game ends in a tie
//   midGame:      a game a few turns into play
