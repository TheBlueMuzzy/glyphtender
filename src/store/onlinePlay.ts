// ONLINE PLAY IN THE STORE (design/online.md §4). The server owns the real game; this device gets views of it.
//   · MY seat plans and animates exactly like pass-and-play. Cast sends the action at once (gameStore.ts);
//     when the seed lands, the server's new view replaces the game (if it hasn't come yet we wait; every
//     WAIT_FOR_VIEW_MS without it, we ask the server to send it again).
//   · OTHER seats' turns arrive as views with `lastTurn`. They're replayed on the OLD view first — their trail
//     draws on in their colour and holds (trail.ts; anim.json trailLead + trailHold), the glyphling glides
//     from → to, the throw starts after glideSeconds, lands — then the new view is applied and the runeblossom
//     sprouts; the trail is gone with the landing. Views that arrive meanwhile wait in the inbox and play in order.
//   · Anything else (draft placements, refreshes, a rejoin after a gap) is simply applied.
//   · MY refresh plays out on my own tray (B011, refreshFx.ts): the set-aside seeds shrink while the action
//     travels; its view waits for the shrink, then the new seeds grow in. Nobody else sees my seeds.
