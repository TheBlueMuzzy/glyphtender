// WHAT THE BOARD MARKS ABOUT MADE WORDS (word indicators on) — plain functions, tested:
//   the hexes that get the white word border (WordBorders.tsx), and the score sequence after a cast
//   (ScorePops.tsx + useScoreSequence.ts): each seed's Magic, word by word, and when each part plays.
// The turn comes from the rules' events (happened.ts turnOf: who cast, where, the words in order); the Magic of each
// seed is worked out here from the board, which everyone sees (events carry no Magic before the end, on purpose).
