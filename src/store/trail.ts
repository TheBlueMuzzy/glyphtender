// TURN TRAILS — where a turn went, drawn on the board in the player's colour (Muzzy, 2026-10-01: "if we could see the
// paths when other players take their turns, it might help us understand the current state of the game — who is
// playing, where did they move from, where did they shoot from"). Plain functions (tested in trail.test.ts);
// TurnTrail.tsx draws them.
//   plan  — my own turn being planned: a dotted path from the glyphling's spot to where it's moving (the planned
//           halos already ring both ends and the aimed hex)
//   live  — another player's turn being replayed online: their trail draws on (from ring → dotted path → to ring →
//           target ring) and holds a moment BEFORE the glide and throw play (anim.json trailLead / trailHold)
// NO cast arc (Muzzy 2026-10-01: "i don't want players thinking that shots jump things. they are 'straight line
// shots'") and NOTHING after the landing ("the dotted line/paths stick around and shouldn't post cast"): a trail
// is gone once the seed lands — for my own turn and for a replay.
