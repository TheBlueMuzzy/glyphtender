// useRoom — the React hook a game's screens use to be in an online room.  (Browser only.)
//
//   const online = useRoom<MyView, MyAction, MyOptions, MyEvent>(roomCode, { name, create })
//   online.status   'idle' (no code) · 'connecting' · 'open' · 'reconnecting' · 'closed'
//   online.room     seats, phase, host… (null until the server answers)
//   online.mySeat   your own seat (null if you have none)
//   online.view     your view of the game, straight from the server's viewFor()
//   online.send(action)   a game move → the server's rules check it
//   online.leave()        ALWAYS leave through this (a plain socket close looks like a dropped connection)
//
// Pass roomCode = null when not online. Changing the code connects to the new room.
// Unmounting (or React StrictMode's practice unmount in dev) just drops the connection — it does
// NOT give up the seat, and the next mount takes the seat straight back. Only leave() gives it up.
