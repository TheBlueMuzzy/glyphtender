// GAME RULES — what a game plugs into its room server. This file is the whole contract.  (Server.)
//
// The room server runs rooms (seats, host, joining, rejoining, bots taking over idle seats).
// The game only says how ITS game works:
//   start a game → check a move → apply it → what each player may see → is it over?
// The game state lives on the server. After every change each connected player is sent
// viewFor(state, theirSeat) — so hidden things (hands, bags, scores) stay hidden in the data,
// not just on screen.
