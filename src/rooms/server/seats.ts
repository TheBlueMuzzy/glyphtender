// SEATS — who sits where, who's host, and what happens when people come and go.  (Server.)
// Plain functions on plain data, with no connections or timers in sight, so every rule here
// is tested on its own (seats.test.ts). RoomServer calls these and does the sending.
//
// The rules (from Roll Better, which proved them with real players):
// - A player's persistentId owns their seat. Come back with it — after a reload, a dropped
//   connection, even after a bot took over — and you get your seat back.
// - Lobby: a player who drops out loses their seat (they rejoin at the end when they're back).
// - Mid-game: a seat is never removed. Dropping out marks it "not connected"; leaving on purpose,
//   or missing too many turns, hands it to a bot. The game carries on.
// - Host: stays host while connected. If not, the first connected human (in seat order) becomes host.
