// ROOM PROTOCOL — every message between a player's browser and the room server.

//
// The room part (join, seats, host, ready, start…) is the same for every game.
// The game's own part is opaque here: an `action` (player → server) and a `view` / `event`
// (server → player). Each game says what's inside with its own types.
