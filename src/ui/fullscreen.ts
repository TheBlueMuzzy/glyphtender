// FULL SCREEN — so a phone on its side shows the whole game, not the browser's bars (Muzzy, 2026-10-03: "I send these
// links out to test with friends… I want them to experience the game as it is meant to be experienced").
// A browser only goes full screen from a tap or a click, never by itself as the page opens. So:
//   phones & tablets (touch): with Settings → Display → Full screen on (the default there), the first tap goes full
//     screen — and so does the next tap after leaving it (the phone's back gesture). Turn it off to stay in the browser.
//   computers: never on their own — the main menu's Full screen button or the Settings toggle (Esc leaves, which
//     turns the setting off).
//   iPhone: Safari can't make a page full screen; "Add to Home Screen" opens it like an app, with no browser bars.
//     Settings shows that tip instead of the toggle.
//   installed (opened from the home screen): already without browser bars — the button and the row are hidden.
