// THE LIVE CONNECTION — mounted (App.tsx) for as long as this device is in a room, so the socket stays open
// through the lobby, the game and the end table. It runs the rooms module's useRoom and passes things on:
//   views → the game store (onlinePlay.ts) · refused moves → the store · other problems → a toast
//   a bot takes another player's seat / they're back → a toast (seatStatus.ts, B015)
//   shut out (no such room, full, started, kicked…) → back to the menu with the reason in friendly words
// While the connection is coming back it shows the kit's Reconnecting box.
