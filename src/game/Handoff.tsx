// PASS THE DEVICE — between two players on one device, when "hide seeds" is on: "Pass to Blue" in Blue's
// colour, over the garden (still visible, dimmed). The tray stays hidden until Blue taps "Show my seeds".
// The store decides WHEN (store.handoff — after the draft, and whenever play passes to another local player,
// after any refresh). This screen only waits for a thrown seed to finish growing (and its score sequence to fade
// away — the store's `scoring` blocks play for the same time), so everyone sees the move and nothing is left over.
// Tapping "Show my seeds" is the moment the VIEWER seat switches to Blue (store/viewer.ts) — until then the screen
// stays with the last person who looked.
// Kit parts only: Screen (dialog = dims what's under it), Panel, Avatar, Text, Button.
