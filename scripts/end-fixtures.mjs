// FINISHED-GAME SNAPSHOTS for the end screen — 2, 3 and 4 players and a shared win, played by the engine's greedy
// sim player with the official word list, saved in e2e/fixtures/ for the e2e end-screen shots (npm run e2e:end).
// Not in content/snapshots/: everything there is bundled into the Dev Kit, which ships in live builds — these ~300 KB
// would download on every page load. (Same snapshot shape, so one can still be pasted into the Dev Kit by hand.)
//   node scripts/end-fixtures.mjs
// Uses Vite to load the TypeScript engine (no build needed). Picks the first seed whose game earned several highlights
// (3+, by at least 2 players) and has at least one tangle mark on the chart, so the pictures have something to show.
